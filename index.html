                <h1>Hobbies and Intrests</h1>
                <p>Personally I love to play video games with my friends. Ever since I was little I would always be playing games and having fun with my buddys but 
                    that still doesn't stop me from going outside and enjoying the world. I love to go on hikes and explore new places. I also love to go to the beach, since I 
                    did live in Hawai'i. I also love to learn more about food and the types of food that pairs well with each other, who would've thought that 
                    mango would be good in a salsa?

                <h1>My hometown</h1>
                <p>I grew up in Kaua'i, Hawai'i and I am proud to represent that where ever I go. If you haven't been there before to the average person it is like paradise
                    and to some extent it is. But to most locals it is home and we love it. The culture of there is nothing that I have ever experienced here in the mainland.
                    There isn't as much opportunity there compared to here but I would still go back in a heartbeat. The people you meet are 90% always showing grace and 
                    kindness to you and it is just a great place to be. In all of the great things that Hawai'i brings, there is one thing that tops all else and that is 
                    the food, now you can get a lunch plate for under $10 with a drink included, some spots even under $5.
